class ArtificialAgent:
    """
    Agent interface for solving minesweeper game.

    Implements core agent methods for interacting with minesweeper game:
      - new_game
      - observe
      - act
      - think
        - core logic wrapper
        - provide basic thinking:
          - always use hints
          - finish game when only mines are remaining
        - logic should be implemented in Subclass in think_impl method
          which is called by think
